DESCRIPTION
The 'cursorline' setting makes it easy to locate the cursor position. However,
when there are split windows, each one shows its cursor line, and the only
indication of the currently active window is the different 'statusline'
highlighting (with hl-StatusLine vs. hl-StatusLineNC).

This plugin avoids the clutter of multiple highlighted screen lines with split
windows by disabling the 'cursorline' setting for all but the current window.
Unlike a simplistic solution with a few autocmds, this plugin still allows for
exceptions like disabling the cursorline for a particular window or making it
permanent for (another) window.

RELATED WORKS
The basic idea is outlined in the Vim Tips Wiki:
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Highlight_current_line

USAGE
Globally enable 'cursorline' in your vimrc via
    :set cursorline
After sourcing this plugin, 'cursorline' will only be active for the current
window. So with multiple split windows, only one of them, the one where the
cursor is in, will have the 'cursorline'.

Disable cursorline for the current window via:
    :setlocal nocursorline
This will persist even after moving away and back to the window.

Disable cursorline globally via:
    :set nocursorline
As soon as you enter a window, its line highlighting will vanish.

For some kind of files it is helpful to keep the line highlighting active,
e.g. to serve as a ruler. You can keep the highlighting for a particular
window by setting a window-local variable:
    :let w:persistent_cursorline = 1
