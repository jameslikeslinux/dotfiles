DESCRIPTION				 *CursorLineCurrentWindow-description*

The 'cursorline' setting makes it easy to locate the cursor position. However,
when there are split windows, each one shows its cursor line, and the only
indication of the currently active window is the different 'statusline'
highlighting (with |hl-StatusLine| vs. |hl-StatusLineNC|).

This plugin avoids the clutter of multiple highlighted screen lines with split
windows by disabling the 'cursorline', 'cursorcolumn', and/or 'wincolor'
settings for all but the current window. Unlike a simplistic solution with a
few autocmds, this plugin still allows for exceptions like disabling the
cursorline for a particular window or making it permanent for (another)
window.

SEE ALSO								     *

- The RelativeNumberCurrentWindow plugin (vimscript #4461) enables the
  'relativenumber' setting only for the current window.

RELATED WORKS								     *

The basic idea is outlined in the Vim Tips Wiki:
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Highlight_current_line
- cursorline_current.vim (vimscript #5740) enables cursorline only in the
  current window and when not in insert mode.

==============================================================================
USAGE					       *CursorLineCurrentWindow-usage*

Globally enable 'cursorline', 'cursorcolumn' and/or 'wincolor' in your
|vimrc|; e.g. >
    :set cursorline cursorcolumn
After sourcing this plugin, the option(s) will only be active for the current
window. So with multiple split windows, only one of them, the one where the
cursor is in, will have 'cursorline' and 'cursorcolumn' enabled.


Disable cursorline for the current window via: >
    :setlocal nocursorline
This will persist even after moving away and back to the window.

Disable cursorline globally via: >
    :set nocursorline
As soon as you enter a window, its line highlighting will vanish.

 *w:persistent_cursorline* *w:persistent_cursorcolumn* *w:persistent_wincolor*
For some kind of files it is helpful to keep the line highlighting active,
e.g. to serve as a ruler. You can keep the highlighting for a particular
window by setting a window-local variable: >
    :let w:persistent_cursorline = 1

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				*CursorLineCurrentWindow-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-CursorLineCurrentWindow
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim CursorLineCurrentWindow*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				*CursorLineCurrentWindow-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION			       *CursorLineCurrentWindow-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
				       *g:CursorLineCurrentWindow_OptionNames*
By default, the plugin will localize any of 'cursorline', 'cursorcolumn', or
'wincolor' options, provided they are set during startup. To cover options
that may be set on demand or to drop a set option, the List of option names
can be overridden: >
    let g:CursorLineCurrentWindow_OptionNames = ['cursorline']
<
